            In image analysis one often encounters spherical images, for instance in retinal imaging. 
            The behavior of the vessels in the retina is an indicator of several diseases.
            To automate disease diagnosis using retinal images,  it is necessary to develop an algorithm that automatically identifies and tracks vessels. 
            To deal with crossings due to projected blood vessels in the image it is common to lift retinal images to the space of <em>planar</em> positions and orientations. This implicitly assumes that the flat image accurately represents the geometry of the retina.
            As the eyeball is a sphere (and not a plane), we propose to compute the <em>cusp-free, crossing-preserving</em> geodesics in the space of <em>spherical</em> positions and orientations on wide-field images. We clarify how to relate both manifolds and compare the calculated geodesics. The results show clear advantages of crossing-preserving tracking over non-crossing-preserving tracking in the space of spherical positions and orientations, and are comparable to tracking results in the space of planar positions and orientations.
