            We extend
            <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10851-024-01175-0">Regularised Diffusion-Shock (RDS) filtering</a>
            from two dimensional Euclidean
            space to the space of positions and orientations.
            This has numerous advantages, e.g. making it possible to enhance and inpaint crossing structures,
            since they become disentangled when lifted. 
            We create a version of the algorithm using gauge frames to mitigate issues caused by lifting to a
            finite number of orientations. This leads us to study generalisations of diffusion, since the gauge
            frame diffusion is not generated by the Laplace-Beltrami operator.
            RDS filtering compares favourably to existing techniques such as 
            <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00211-019-01026-w">Total Roto-Translational Variation flow</a>, 
            <a href="https://doi.org/10.5201/ipol.2011.bcm_nlm">Non-Local Means</a>, and
            <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2007.901238">BM3D</a> when denoising images with crossing structures, particularly if they are segmented.
            Additionally, we see that RDS inpainting on the space of positions and orientations is indeed able
            to restore crossing structures, unlike its Euclidean counterpart.
