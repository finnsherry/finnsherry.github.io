            We investigate so-called <em>vitrimers</em>, polymer materials with reversible, associative bonds. Vitrimers can interpolate between traditional thermoplastics and thermosets. Due to the reversible nature of their bonds, they become malleable at high temperatures like thermoplastics, allowing them to heal damage. Since the bonds are additionally associative, however, at all times the total number of bonds is fixed: this makes vitrimers resistant to solvents and creep like thermosets.

            Previous (simulation) work by <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/COATINGS9020114">Ciarella & Ellenbroek</a> has shown that vitrimers made of star-shaped polymers are particularly suitable for making strong, self-healing materials: they remain rigid on timescales around three orders of magnitude greater than their healing time. We seek to improve upon this result by using comb instead of star polymers, hypothesising that the networks will heal on similar timescales, which being stable for much longer due to the entanglement of the backbones.

            We first develop a simple theoretical model to predict the typical bond swap times in the network, and test this using Molecular Dynamics simulations; our model appears to extrapolate well outside of the data it was fitted on. The simulations additionally show that the swap times cannot be described by an exponential or Weibull distribution. Using these typical swap times, we derive an expression for the evolution of the number of bonds around damage and the equilibrium shear modulus. These models are again tested using Molecular Dynamics simulations. We see that the vitrimer networks based on combs indeed heal at similar speeds to the one based on stars, confirming the first part of our hypothesis. Finally, we measure the stress relaxation of a comb vitrimer network using Molecular Dynamics simulations to find the timescale on which the network is rigid. Unfortunately, we believe we have encountered an issue in the implementation of the dynamic bonds in simulations, causing us to observe a nonphysical stress relaxation; we therefore have been unable to test the second part of our hypothesis.
